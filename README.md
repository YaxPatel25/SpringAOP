This project is illustrate the concepts of AOP(Aspect Oriented Programming) in Spring.
- In Logging.java file, all the advices have been written.
- @Getter, @Setter & @AllArgsConstructor are not working for the User class. So, it is traaditionally implemented.
- When you run the appliction, see the console for the Tomcat server to identify port number. And then, you can start the application as we used @GetMapping("/") in Api.java.
